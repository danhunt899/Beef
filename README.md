# Beef
A GUI based game derived from Cluedo. Another assignment for SWEN222, we built on our existing code from the Cluedo
assignment to build a GUI, again in pairs. We decided to make our game 1990s Rap Music themed, replacing all the
characters weapons and locations with Rap versions, such as Tupac and Eminem. 

As we used past code from the Cluedo assignment there is quite a bit of innecessary code but we were working with a 
quick turnaround so we left it in the game. Again worked with Raymond Gueze
